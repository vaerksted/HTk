[HTk](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/htk) is an encapsulation of the graphical user interface toolkit and library Tcl/Tk for the functional programming language Haskell. It allows the creation of high-quality graphical user interfaces within Haskell in a typed, abstract, and portable manner, as HTk is known to run under most POSIX systems, like Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X.
